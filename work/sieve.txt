Input:  an integer n > 1

Let A be an array of Boolean values, indexed by integers 2 to n,
    initially all set to true.

for i = 2, 3, 4, ..., not exceding sqrt(n):
  if A[i] is true:
    for j = i^2, i^2 + i, i^2 + 2i, i^2 + 3i, ..., not exceeding n :
      A[j] := false

Output: all i such that A[i] is true.
